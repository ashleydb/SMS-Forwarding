# SMS-Forwarding

For scraping SMS messages sent to Netgear Nighthawk mobile routers and forwarding them as emails.

See myselenium.py for the final code.

These are some of the steps needed for setup:

## Browser and Driver Setup
We're using an OrangePi 3-LTS with Ubuntu 3.x.
This comes with Firefox as a "snap". That means it is located at:
  /usr/bin/firefox-esr

Get the Firefox WebDriver from:
  https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Get the linux-aarch64 version.

Extract it, then make it executable:
  sudo chmod +x geckodriver

Move the file to a folder within the $PATH, e.g.
  sudo mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin

## Email Sending Setup
For sending emails via GMail I needed an App Password from Google, which itself requires 2-Step Verification to be setup on the account.

## Credentials Setup
Be sure to update the script to add usernames, passwords, and email addresses at the top.

## Run on Boot and Restarting
Getting it to run on boot using rc.local:

And getting the device to reboot every day at 1:01am (1am, with a 70 sec sleep) using cron:

0 1 * * * sleep 70 && reboot

(This is how to configure the timing in cron: https://crontab.guru/every-day-at-1am)
